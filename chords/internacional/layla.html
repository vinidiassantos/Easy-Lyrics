[Dm] What'll you do when you get lonely
[Bb] And nobody's waiting by your side?
[G] You've been running and hiding much too long
[A] You know it's just your foolish pride
[Dm] Layla
[Bb] You've got me on my knees
[G] Layla
[A] I'm begging, darling please
[Dm] Layla
[Bb] Darling won't you ease my worried mind
