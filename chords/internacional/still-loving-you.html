[Am] Time, it needs time
[F] To win back your love again
[G] I will be there
[C] I will be there

[Am] Love, only love
[F] Can bring back your love someday
[G] I will be there
[C] I will be there

[Am] Fight, babe, I'll fight
[F] To win back your love again
[G] I will be there
[C] I will be there

[Am] Love, only love
[F] Can break down the walls someday
[G] I will be there
[C] I will be there

[Am] If we'd go again
[F] All the way from the start
[G] I would try to change
[C] The things that killed our love
[Am] Yes, I've hurt your pride
[F] And I know what you've been through
[G] You should give me a chance
[C] This can't be the end
