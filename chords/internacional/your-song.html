<span class="chord">Eb</span>               <span class="chord">Ab</span>
It's a little bit funny, this feeling inside
<span class="chord">Bb</span>               <span class="chord">Cm</span>
I'm not one of those who can easily hide
<span class="chord">Eb</span>               <span class="chord">Ab</span>
I don't have much money, but boy if I did
<span class="chord">Bb</span>               <span class="chord">Cm</span>
I'd buy a big house where we both could live

<span class="chord">Eb</span>               <span class="chord">Ab</span>
If I was a sculptor, but then again, no
<span class="chord">Bb</span>               <span class="chord">Cm</span>
Or a man who makes potions in a traveling show
<span class="chord">Eb</span>               <span class="chord">Ab</span>
I know it's not much but it's the best I can do
<span class="chord">Bb</span>               <span class="chord">Cm</span>
My gift is my song and this one's for you

<span class="chord">Eb</span>               <span class="chord">Ab</span>
And you can tell everybody this is your song
<span class="chord">Bb</span>               <span class="chord">Cm</span>
It may be quite simple but now that it's done
<span class="chord">Eb</span>               <span class="chord">Ab</span>
I hope you don't mind, I hope you don't mind
<span class="chord">Bb</span>               <span class="chord">Cm</span>
That I put down in words
<span class="chord">Eb</span>               <span class="chord">Ab</span>
How wonderful life is while you're in the world

<span class="chord">Eb</span>               <span class="chord">Ab</span>
I sat on the roof and kicked off the moss
<span class="chord">Bb</span>               <span class="chord">Cm</span>
Well a few of the verses, well they've got me quite cross
<span class="chord">Eb</span>               <span class="chord">Ab</span>
But the sun's been quite kind while I wrote this song
<span class="chord">Bb</span>               <span class="chord">Cm</span>
It's for people like you that keep it turned on

<span class="chord">Eb</span>               <span class="chord">Ab</span>
So excuse me forgetting, but these things I do
<span class="chord">Bb</span>               <span class="chord">Cm</span>
You see I've forgotten if they're green or they're blue
<span class="chord">Eb</span>               <span class="chord">Ab</span>
Anyway the thing is, what I really mean
<span class="chord">Bb</span>               <span class="chord">Cm</span>
Yours are the sweetest eyes I've ever seen

<span class="chord">Eb</span>               <span class="chord">Ab</span>
And you can tell everybody this is your song
<span class="chord">Bb</span>               <span class="chord">Cm</span>
It may be quite simple but now that it's done
<span class="chord">Eb</span>               <span class="chord">Ab</span>
I hope you don't mind, I hope you don't mind
<span class="chord">Bb</span>               <span class="chord">Cm</span>
That I put down in words
<span class="chord">Eb</span>               <span class="chord">Ab</span>
How wonderful life is while you're in the world
