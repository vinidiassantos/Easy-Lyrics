[G] I am sailing, [C] I am sailing
[D] Home again 'cross the [G] sea
[G] I am sailing, [C] stormy waters
[D] To be near you, to be [G] free

[G] I am flying, [C] I am flying
[D] Like a bird 'cross the [G] sky
[G] I am flying, [C] passing high clouds
[D] To be near you, to be [G] free

[G] Can you hear me, [C] can you hear me
[D] Through the dark night, [G] far away
[G] I am dying, [C] forever crying
[D] To be with you, who can [G] say

[G] We are sailing, [C] we are sailing
[D] Home again 'cross the [G] sea
[G] We are sailing, [C] stormy waters
[D] To be near you, to be [G] free
