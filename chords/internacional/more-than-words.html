[G] Saying I love you
[C] Is not the words I want to hear from you
[D] It's not that I want you
[Em] Not to say, but if you only knew

[G] How easy it would be to show me how you feel
[C] More than words is all you have to do
[D] To make it real
[Em] Then you wouldn't have to say
[G] That you love me
[C] 'Cause I'd already know
