    <pre>
[C] I can tell by your eyes
[G] That you've probably been crying forever
[Am] And the stars in the sky
[F] Don't mean nothing to you, they're a mirror

[C] I don't wanna talk about it
[G] How you broke my heart
[Am] If I stay here just a little bit longer
[F] If I stay here, won't you listen to my heart?
