[B] Look at the stars
[E] Look how they shine for you
[F#] And everything you do
[G#m] Yeah, they were all yellow

[B] I came along
[E] I wrote a song for you
[F#] And all the things you do
[G#m] And it was called "Yellow"

[B] So then I took my turn
[E] Oh, what a thing to've done
[F#] And it was all yellow
